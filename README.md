# CNN_model_CUMerced_LandUse_Classification-

In this project, in order to classify land use of satellite images, I used the UC Merced Land-use dataset, which include 21 land use classes, for this porpuse.
Each class consist of 100 images including:
1- agricultural
2- airplane
3- baseballdiamond
4- beach
5- buildings
6- chaparral
7- denseresidential
8- forest
9- freeway
10- golfcourse
11- harbor
12- intersection
13- mediumresidential
14- mobilehomepark
15- overpass
16- parkinglot
17- river
18- runway
19- sparseresidential
20- storagetanks
21- tenniscourt
Each image 256x256 pixels. The images were manually extracted from large images from the USGS National Map Urban Area Imagery collection for various urban areas in the US. The pixes resolution of the images is 1 foot.
